# PCL-Urban-Models

This is my graduation project report, in Chinese version.

I created a program on reconstruction of urban buildings model from LiDAR point clouds data based on C++ PCL library 
and improved the algorithm and realized the extraction and reconstruction of windows on the buildings.

The code is too large, and it can be acquired by baidu pan: https://pan.baidu.com/s/1nJHSjTOpnXuPzTNN9TJWkg. The password is sgiy.
